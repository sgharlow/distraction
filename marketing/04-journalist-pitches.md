# Item 4: Journalist Pitch Emails

## How to Find Contacts

Search these patterns on each outlet's website:
- "[outlet] tips" or "[outlet] contact us"
- Twitter/Bluesky bios of beat reporters (they often list email)
- LinkedIn: search "[outlet] media reporter" or "[outlet] civic tech"

## Pitch 1: Nieman Lab (Harvard)

**To:** tips@niemanlab.org (or specific reporter)
**Subject:** New open-source tool scores political events on dual axes — damage vs. distraction

Hi,

I'm reaching out about The Distraction Index (https://distractionindex.org), an open-source civic intelligence project that I think Nieman Lab's audience would find interesting.

Unlike media bias charts that rate sources, The Distraction Index scores individual political events on two independent axes:
- **Constitutional Damage** — 7 weighted drivers measuring institutional harm
- **Media Distraction** — a two-layer model separating organic hype from strategic manipulation

The result is a weekly frozen snapshot that becomes a permanent historical record. 59 weeks of data, 1,500+ scored events, all with full algorithmic transparency.

The most novel feature is the "Smokescreen Index" — an automated pairing of high-distraction events with concurrent high-damage events that received disproportionately low coverage. We've identified 210+ such pairs since December 2024.

Every formula, weight, and scoring prompt is documented publicly at /methodology. The codebase is open source.

Would this be relevant for Nieman Lab's coverage of journalism innovation and media analysis tools?

## Pitch 2: Columbia Journalism Review (CJR)

**To:** editors@cjr.org (or specific reporter covering media criticism)
**Subject:** Transparent alternative to opaque media bias ratings — event-level dual-axis scoring

Hi,

I wanted to share a project that takes a fundamentally different approach to measuring media coverage patterns.

Most media bias tools rate sources. The Distraction Index (https://distractionindex.org) rates events — scoring each on constitutional damage AND media distraction independently. This reveals something bias charts can't: when high-distraction events are actively masking concurrent institutional damage.

Key differentiators:
- Scores events, not outlets
- Two independent axes (not a single left-right spectrum)
- Full algorithmic transparency — every weight and formula is published
- Immutable weekly snapshots with append-only corrections
- 59 weeks of historical data (Dec 2024 — present)

The methodology page documents everything: https://distractionindex.org/methodology

I'd be happy to discuss the design decisions behind the scoring model, the challenges of automated political event scoring, or the broader question of whether algorithmic transparency can build public trust in media analysis tools.

## Pitch 3: Poynter Institute

**To:** Contact via https://www.poynter.org/contact/ (or specific fact-checking reporter)
**Subject:** Open-source tool for media literacy — dual-axis event scoring with full transparency

Hi,

I'm building a tool I think could be valuable for media literacy education, and I wanted to share it with Poynter.

The Distraction Index (https://distractionindex.org) helps users distinguish between political events that cause real democratic harm and events engineered to dominate attention. Each event is scored on two independent axes — damage and distraction — with every algorithm weight and formula documented publicly.

For educators, the weekly frozen snapshots make excellent teaching material: students can examine which events were classified as Damage vs. Distraction, explore the scoring breakdowns, and analyze smokescreen pairs (when media spectacle masked real harm).

59 weeks of immutable data, 1,500+ scored events, fully open source.

Would this be relevant for Poynter's media literacy or fact-checking coverage?

## Pitch 4: The Markup

**To:** tips@themarkup.org
**Subject:** Data-driven civic intelligence: AI-scored political events with full algorithmic transparency

Hi,

Given The Markup's focus on data-driven accountability journalism, I thought you might be interested in The Distraction Index (https://distractionindex.org).

It's an automated pipeline that:
1. Ingests articles from 3 news sources every 4 hours
2. Clusters them into distinct events using Claude Haiku
3. Scores each event on two axes using Claude Sonnet — constitutional damage (7 weighted drivers) and media distraction (two-layer hype model)
4. Publishes immutable weekly snapshots with full scoring transparency

The algorithmic transparency angle might be especially relevant — every weight, formula, and even the AI prompt templates are documented publicly. The goal is to demonstrate that automated political analysis can be transparent and auditable, not a black box.

59 weeks of data, 1,500+ scored events, 210+ smokescreen pairs identified. Open source.

Would love to discuss the technical approach or the broader challenge of building trust in AI-powered civic tools.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Pitch 5: ProPublica

**To:** tips@propublica.org
**Subject:** 210+ "smokescreen" events identified — when media spectacle masks democratic damage

Hi,

I've built a civic intelligence tool that automatically identifies when high-distraction political events coincide with undercovered democratic damage — what we call "smokescreen pairs."

The Distraction Index (https://distractionindex.org) scores every major political event on two independent axes: constitutional damage and media distraction. When a high-B (distraction) event co-occurs with a high-A (damage) event that received disproportionately less coverage, we flag it as a potential smokescreen.

We've identified 210+ such pairs across 59 weeks (Dec 2024 — present). The full list is at https://distractionindex.org/smokescreen.

The scoring methodology is fully transparent and the project is open source. I'm sharing this because ProPublica's investigative team might find the undercovered damage events (https://distractionindex.org/undercovered) useful as story leads.

## Pitch 6: TechCrunch (Civic Tech beat)

**To:** tips@techcrunch.com (or specific civic tech reporter)
**Subject:** Open-source civic tech: AI pipeline scores 1,500+ political events on dual axes

Hi,

I built an open-source civic intelligence platform that uses AI to score political events on two independent axes — constitutional damage vs. media distraction.

**The Distraction Index** (https://distractionindex.org) runs an automated pipeline every 4 hours:
- Ingests articles from GDELT, GNews, and Google News RSS
- Clusters articles into events using Claude Haiku
- Dual-axis scoring using Claude Sonnet with structured prompts
- Publishes immutable weekly snapshots

Tech stack: Next.js 16, Supabase, Claude API, Vercel. 220 tests, fully open source.

The novel contribution is the dual-axis approach — rather than rating media sources on a bias spectrum, it rates individual events on both damage AND distraction, revealing when spectacle masks substance.

59 weeks of data, 1,500+ events scored, open source at GitHub.

Happy to discuss the technical architecture, AI scoring challenges, or the product decisions behind immutable weekly snapshots.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Sending Strategy

1. **Personalize each email** — Look up the specific reporter's recent articles and reference one
2. **Send Tuesday-Thursday morning** (9-11 AM ET) for best open rates
3. **Follow up once** after 5-7 days if no response
4. **Don't mass-blast** — send 2-3 per day maximum
5. **Track in a spreadsheet:** Outlet | Contact | Date Sent | Follow-up Date | Response
