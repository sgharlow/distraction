## Email 1: News Literacy Project

**To:** Contact via https://newslit.org/contact/
**Subject:** Free civic intelligence tool for media literacy education

Hi,

I've built an open-source tool that I think could be valuable as a teaching resource for media literacy programs.

**The Distraction Index** (https://distractionindex.org) publishes weekly scored snapshots of political events, measuring each on two independent axes: constitutional damage and media distraction. The full scoring methodology is documented transparently at /methodology.

**Why it works for education:**
- Students can compare what they *think* are the biggest stories vs. what scored highest on each axis
- The "Smokescreen" page shows when media spectacle masks real institutional harm
- The "Undercovered" page highlights high-damage events with low media attention
- Every weight and formula is documented — students can critique the methodology itself
- 59 weeks of immutable historical data for longitudinal analysis

The tool is free, open source, and has no advertising or editorial influence.

Would you be interested in exploring how this could complement News Literacy Project's curriculum?

## Email 2: MediaWise (Poynter)

**To:** Contact via https://www.poynter.org/mediawise/
**Subject:** Interactive tool for teaching media literacy — dual-axis political event scoring

Hi MediaWise team,

I'm reaching out about a free civic tech tool that might complement your media literacy programs for young adults.

The Distraction Index (https://distractionindex.org) scores political events on two axes — real institutional damage vs. media hype. Students can explore:

- Why some events dominate headlines despite low actual impact
- When media spectacle coincides with undercovered institutional harm
- How to evaluate the methodology behind any scoring system (all our weights are published)

The weekly format (new snapshot every Sunday) creates a natural classroom cadence — "What did the Distraction Index reveal this week?"

Open source, no ads, transparent methodology. Would love to discuss potential classroom applications.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Email 3: AllSides

**To:** Contact via https://www.allsides.com/contact
**Subject:** Partnership opportunity — complementary approaches to media analysis

Hi AllSides team,

I've built a tool that takes a complementary approach to your media bias ratings — The Distraction Index (https://distractionindex.org).

Where AllSides rates *sources* on a left-right spectrum, The Distraction Index rates *events* on two independent axes: constitutional damage and media distraction. This reveals patterns that source-level analysis can't — like when high-distraction events across ALL sources mask concurrent institutional damage.

I'd love to explore whether there's a partnership opportunity — perhaps cross-linking, or featuring the Distraction Index as a complementary resource alongside AllSides' source ratings. Our approaches don't compete; they reveal different dimensions of the media landscape.

59 weeks of data, fully transparent methodology, open source.

Best,

## Email 4: Ad Fontes Media

**To:** info@adfontesmedia.com
**Subject:** Complementary tool to the Media Bias Chart — event-level dual-axis scoring

Hi Ad Fontes team,

I'm a fan of the Media Bias Chart and wanted to share a project that addresses a dimension your chart doesn't cover — event-level scoring.

The Distraction Index (https://distractionindex.org) scores individual political events on two independent axes: constitutional damage (how much institutional harm) and media distraction (how much the event is amplified vs. substance). This reveals patterns like "smokescreen" events — when media hype coincides with undercovered damage.

I think our tools are complementary rather than competitive. The Bias Chart answers "Is this source reliable?" while the Distraction Index answers "Is this event genuine damage or manufactured spectacle?"

Would you be open to exploring a link exchange or co-resource listing?

Best,

## Email 5: League of Women Voters

**To:** Contact via local chapter or lwv.org
**Subject:** Free civic intelligence tool for voter education programs

Dear League of Women Voters,

I've developed a free, non-partisan civic intelligence tool that I believe could support your voter education mission.

The Distraction Index (https://distractionindex.org) publishes weekly transparent reports scoring political events on institutional impact vs. media attention. It helps citizens:

- Identify which events matter most for democratic institutions
- Understand when media coverage may not reflect actual governance impact
- Access 59 weeks of immutable historical records

The tool is non-partisan — it measures institutional damage using transparent, documented criteria, not political affiliation. All scoring methodology is public at /methodology.

Would this be useful as a reference tool for your educational programs?

Best,
