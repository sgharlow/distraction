### Title: The Distraction Index: A Dual-Axis Framework for Scoring Democratic Damage and Media Distraction

### Abstract

We present The Distraction Index, an open-source automated system for scoring political events on two independent axes: constitutional damage (Score A) and media distraction (Score B). Score A measures institutional harm using 7 weighted governance drivers with severity multipliers for durability, reversibility, and precedent. Score B uses a two-layer model combining media hype metrics (55%) with strategic manipulation indicators (45%), modulated by an intentionality score. Events are classified by dominance margin into Damage (A >> B), Distraction (B >> A), or Noise. A "Smokescreen Index" identifies co-temporal pairings of high-distraction events with high-damage events that received disproportionately low coverage.

The system has been operational since December 2024, processing articles from GDELT, GNews, and Google News RSS via an automated pipeline. After 59 weeks: 1,500+ scored events, 11,800+ ingested articles, and 210+ identified smokescreen pairs. All scoring formulas, weights, and AI prompt templates are documented publicly. Weekly snapshots are immutable; corrections are append-only and timestamped.

## Email Template for Professors

**Subject:** Open dataset: 59 weeks of dual-scored U.S. political events (damage + distraction axes)

Dear Professor [Name],

I'm writing to share an open dataset that may be relevant to your research on [their specific area — media framing / agenda-setting / democratic institutions / computational journalism].

The Distraction Index is an automated system that scores U.S. political events on two independent axes — constitutional damage and media distraction — and publishes immutable weekly snapshots. The dataset includes:

- 1,500+ dual-scored events (Dec 2024 — present)
- 11,800+ linked articles with publication metadata
- 210+ smokescreen pairs (distraction-damage correlations)
- Full scoring formulas and AI prompt templates

The data is accessible via API and the entire methodology is documented transparently.

Potential research applications:
- Media framing and agenda-setting studies
- Democratic backsliding measurement
- Attention economics and information competition
- AI-assisted journalism methodology evaluation
- Longitudinal civic health indicators

I'd be happy to provide a structured data export or answer questions about the methodology.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
