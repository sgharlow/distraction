AI-scored weekly reports: democratic damage vs. media distractions

### Description
The Distraction Index scores every major U.S. political event on two independent axes: constitutional damage (institutional harm) and media distraction (hype vs. strategic manipulation). Each week, a new immutable snapshot is published with full algorithmic transparency.

Features:
- Dual-axis scoring with 7 governance drivers and two-layer distraction model
- Smokescreen detection — when media spectacle masks real institutional harm
- 59+ weeks of immutable historical data
- Full methodology transparency — every formula, weight, and AI prompt is published
- Automated pipeline ingesting from 3 news sources every 4 hours
- Open source

### First Comment (post immediately after launch)
Hey Product Hunt! I'm the creator of The Distraction Index.

The core insight: political events have two dimensions that should be measured independently — how much real institutional damage they cause, and how much media attention they generate. When these are wildly mismatched, something interesting is happening.

I score each event on two axes:
- **Score A** (Constitutional Damage): 7 weighted drivers — judicial independence, press freedom, voting rights, environmental policy, etc.
- **Score B** (Distraction/Hype): Two-layer model — raw media amplification vs. strategic manipulation

The "Smokescreen Index" automatically pairs high-distraction events with concurrent high-damage events that got less coverage. 210+ pairs identified so far.

Everything is transparent — the /methodology page documents every formula, weight, and AI prompt. Weekly snapshots are permanently frozen. Corrections are append-only.

Tech: Next.js 16, Supabase, Claude API (Haiku for clustering, Sonnet for scoring), GDELT + GNews + Google News RSS.

Would love your feedback on the scoring model!

### Title
I built an AI-powered civic intelligence platform — 59 weeks of scored political events

### Body
I've been running The Distraction Index (https://distractionindex.org) for over a year. It's an automated pipeline that:

1. Ingests articles from 3 news sources every 4 hours
2. Clusters them into events using Claude Haiku
3. Scores each event on two axes using Claude Sonnet
4. Publishes immutable weekly snapshots

**The numbers after 59 weeks:**
- 1,500+ scored events
- 11,800+ ingested articles
- 210+ smokescreen pairs detected
- 220 tests, fully open source

**Tech stack:** Next.js 16, Supabase, Claude API, Vercel
**Monthly cost:** ~$30 (Supabase free tier + Claude API usage + Vercel Pro)

**Revenue model:** Currently free / open source. Exploring newsletter sponsorships and data API licensing.

The interesting challenge: building trust in automated political analysis. My solution was radical transparency — every scoring formula, weight, and AI prompt is documented publicly.

Happy to answer questions about the tech, the scoring methodology, or the product decisions.
