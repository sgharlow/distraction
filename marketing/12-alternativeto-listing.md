## Application Name
The Distraction Index

## URL
https://distractionindex.org

## Description
The Distraction Index is a free, open-source civic intelligence platform that scores every major U.S. political event on two independent axes: constitutional damage (institutional harm) and media distraction (hype vs. strategic manipulation). Each week, a new immutable snapshot is published with full algorithmic transparency — every scoring formula, weight, and AI prompt is documented publicly. After 59+ weeks: 1,500+ scored events, 210+ smokescreen pairs detected. Unlike media bias charts that rate sources, The Distraction Index scores events on dual dimensions to reveal when media spectacle masks real democratic harm.
