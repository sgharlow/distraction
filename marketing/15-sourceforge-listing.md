## Short Description (one line)
AI-powered civic intelligence platform scoring political events on constitutional damage vs. media distraction axes.

## Full Description

The Distraction Index is an open-source civic intelligence platform that publishes weekly reports scoring every major U.S. political event on two independent dimensions:

**Score A — Constitutional Damage (0-100):**
Measures actual harm to democratic institutions using 7 weighted governance drivers (judicial independence, press freedom, voting rights, environmental policy, civil liberties, international norms, fiscal governance) with severity multipliers for durability, reversibility, and precedent.

**Score B — Distraction/Hype (0-100):**
Two-layer model combining media amplification metrics (55%) with strategic manipulation indicators (45%), modulated by an intentionality score.

**Key Features:**
- Automated pipeline ingesting articles every 4 hours from GDELT, GNews, and Google News RSS
- Claude Haiku for article clustering, Claude Sonnet for dual-axis scoring
- Smokescreen Index: automatic detection of when media spectacle masks concurrent institutional damage
- Immutable weekly snapshots — historical scores cannot be silently changed
- Full algorithmic transparency — every formula, weight, and AI prompt documented publicly
- 288 tests, fully open source

**After 59+ weeks:** 1,500+ scored events, 11,800+ ingested articles, 210+ smokescreen pairs identified.
