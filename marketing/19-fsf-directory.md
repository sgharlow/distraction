### Short Description
AI-powered civic intelligence platform that scores U.S. political events on two independent axes — constitutional damage and media distraction — publishing immutable weekly snapshots with full algorithmic transparency.

### Full Description
The Distraction Index is a free software civic intelligence platform designed to promote media literacy and democratic accountability. The system uses an automated pipeline to ingest news articles from three sources (GDELT, GNews, Google News RSS) every four hours, cluster them into discrete political events using AI, and score each event on two dimensions:

Score A measures constitutional damage across seven governance drivers (judicial independence, press freedom, voting rights, environmental policy, civil liberties, international norms, fiscal governance) using severity multipliers.

Score B measures media distraction using a two-layer model combining hype metrics with strategic manipulation indicators.

Events where damage is high but media attention is low are flagged as "undercovered." Co-temporal pairings of high-distraction and high-damage events are detected as "smokescreens."

All scoring formulas, weights, and AI prompt templates are published publicly. Weekly data snapshots are immutable — once frozen, scores cannot be altered. Post-freeze corrections are append-only and timestamped. The entire codebase is open source under the MIT license with 288 passing tests.
